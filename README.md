**Project Title: Railway Reservation System**

**Description:**
The Railway Reservation System is a comprehensive application developed using Python and MySQL that aims to streamline the process of railway seat reservation and management. The system provides a user-friendly interface for passengers to conveniently book their train tickets, while also offering secure registration and login processes, email notifications, and efficient seat allocation.

**Features:**

**User Registration and Login:**
Users can securely register for an account with their personal details. The system employs password hashing for enhanced security. Registered users can log in to access their accounts and make reservations.

**Seat Reservation:**
Passengers can search for available trains based on their preferences such as source, destination, and travel date. The system then displays a list of available trains and allows users to select their desired journey. Users can choose their preferred class and number of seats for booking.

**Fair Seat Allocation:**
The system implements a fair seat allocation algorithm to ensure that all passengers have an equal chance of obtaining desirable seats. This prevents biases and ensures a just allocation process.

**Email Notifications:**
After successful reservation, users receive email notifications containing their booking details, including train information, class, seat numbers, and journey date. The system utilizes the SMTP library and MIME formatting to send well-organized emails in both text and HTML formats.

**Error Handling:**
The application incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage situations such as invalid inputs, unavailable trains, or network errors. Users are provided with clear error messages and instructions.

**MySQL Database Integration:**
The project utilizes the MySQL database to store essential information including user accounts, train details, reservations, and seat availability. The mysql.connector library is employed to establish a secure connection between the Python application and the database.

**Data Security:**
The system prioritizes data security by employing password hashing and ensuring that sensitive information is stored securely in the database. This prevents unauthorized access and enhances user privacy.

**Email Validator:**
During registration, the system employs email validation to ensure that users provide a valid and functional email address. This enhances communication reliability and reduces errors.

**Jupyter Notebook Interface:**
The development environment utilized for this project is Jupyter Notebook, which provides an interactive and collaborative platform for coding, testing, and documenting the application.

The Railway Reservation System developed using Python, MySQL, and various libraries demonstrates a successful integration of database management, user authentication, email communication, and fair allocation processes. It offers a complete solution for efficient and user-friendly railway seat reservation, catering to both passengers and administrative needs.
